# Predicting-Workforce-turnover-rate
Workforce turnover (the total number of employees who leave an organization in a particular year) is one of the biggest problem of Mutinational companies. Nowadays the problem is more aggravated by the economic trend of "Great Resignation" or "Big Quit" which companies have experienced during this covid pandemic primarily in USA but it has affected companies worldwide in this globalized economy. 
Hence this project mainly focuses on predicting whether an employee is going to leave the organization in the coming penod. This predictive analysis will help the companies to understand that how many potential employees will leave the organization and will also help in understanding the cause behind high turnover ratio, which in-turn will help in lowering the ratio.
